#summary Vision Statement

==Vision Statement==

_"The vision statement, also known as a project charter, should include an elevator summary of the project, a business case for the project (including a short analysis of the competition, market space, or similar commercial off the shelf software), a description of the project stakeholders, a list of the major features of the completed project, and a list of the major risks of the project."_

The File Renamer is a great utility for the organization-conscious computer user. It will allow anyone to quickly and easily rename many files at once, without the hassle of clicking and typing over and over. Given a simple pattern, a click of a button will rename all of the files that it applies to. The pattern could be a word, a combination of metadata (for music and other media), or even a regular expression.
