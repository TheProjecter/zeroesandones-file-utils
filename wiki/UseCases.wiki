(put the use cases here)
  * Use Case: Simple File Rename
    * ID: UC1
    * Actors:
      * User: wants to easily rename many files at once
    * Precondition:
      * Program is open
      * User has a bunch of inconsistently named target files
    * Sequence of Actions:
      # User selects "Browse"
      # System displays a Browse dialog window
      # User selects the folder that contains the target files
      # System updates display to show the files with their original names
      # User enters text for the "Match" within the target filenames
      # System begins to update display to show the new names of the files
      # User enters text for the "Replacement" within the target filenames
      # UI updates display to show new names that have "Match" replaced with "Replacement"
      # User selects "Apply"
      # System renames each affected file, and displays this change.
    * Post Condition:
      * Files are named consistently, according to the user's input
      * Happy user


  * Use Case: Invalid Regular Expression
    * ID: UC2
    * Actors:
      * User: is attempting to use regular expressions for the file renaming process
    * Precondition:
      * Program is open
      * User has already browsed to a directory containing target files
    * Sequence of Actions:
      # User enters an invalid regular expression for the "Match" on target filenames
      # System identifies the expression as invalid; Updates display with an error notification
    * Post Condition
      * Selecting "Apply" will not cause anything to happen
      * The place where the user can enter "Match" text will be marked up to make the error obvious
