#summary Project Schedule

==Project Schedule==

_A detailed schedule of the phases and iterations of your project. You must include iterations and dates for the development of each use case or feature, as well as estimates of the time required to complete each item on the schedule. The schedule must show the specific dates each phase and iteration ends. Also include preliminary details and timing of the tasks included in completing your project._

The project schedule is set up in 3 phases.

The first phase is the beta phase, the core functionality of the project.
Beta phase will concentrate on 3 weekly builds, with expectations listed below for each build.

=Beta Builds=
==Beta 1==
===Wednesday October 20===
  * Features to be filled in for inception delivery
==Beta 2==
===Wednesday October 27===
  * Features to be filled in for inception delivery
==Beta 3==
===Wednesday November 3===
  * Features to be filled in for inception delivery

The Beta 3 build will be stabilized and cleaned up as much as possible in the week after its launch, as it will be presented on November 10th for a Product Review.

The Alpha Build Session will begin with a discussion of the 1st Product review.  Any concerns or ideas that were suggested during this review will be discussed and we will place these into the alpha build schedule.  Also at this meeting we will brainstorm any more ideas that we have come up internally for extended features on the project.

=Alpha Builds=
==Alpha 1 (Product Review Release)==
===Wednesday November 10===
  * These features will be addressed at the post-review meeting.
==Alpha 2==
===Wednesday November 17===
  * These features will be addressed at the post-review meeting.
==Alpha 3(If necessary)==
===Wednesday November 24===
  * The Alpha 3 release is budgeted in case we get behind in our development schedule up to this point, ideally we should be taking the Alpha 2 build and cleaning it up for the final product presentation.
